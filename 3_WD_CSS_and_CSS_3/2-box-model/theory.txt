Box model : All HTML elements can be considered as boxes.

The css box model:

The CSS Box Model is a fundamental concept in web design and layout. It describes how every HTML element is represented as a rectangular box consisting of several layers. The box model comprises four main parts: Content, Padding, Border, and Margin.

|              Margin                        |
|    |----------------------------------|    |
|    |             Border               |    |
|    |    |------------------------|    |    |
|    |    |         Padding        |    |    |
|    |    |    |--------------|    |    |    |
|    |    |    |   Content    |    |    |    |    
|    |    |    |--------------|    |    |    |

Explanation of the different parts:
Content
The core area of the box where text, images, or other elements are displayed.

Padding
The space between the content and the border. Padding is transparent and increases the space around the content.

Border
A visible line or boundary surrounding the padding and content. The border's thickness, style, and color can be customized.

Margin
The outermost layer that creates space between the element and adjacent elements. Like padding, the margin is also transparent.

Key Notes
Transparency: Both padding and margin do not have any color unless explicitly set. The space they create is transparent.
Customizable: All parts of the box model can be styled using CSS properties like margin, padding, border, and width for the content.
Box-Sizing: By default, the width and height of an element include only the content area. The box-sizing property can change this behavior to include padding and border in the element's width and height.
