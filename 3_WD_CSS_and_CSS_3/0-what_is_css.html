What is css?

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS allows developers to control the layout, appearance, and design of web pages, separating content from presentation.


Key Features of CSS:
-------------------
Styling HTML Elements: CSS provides the ability to apply styles to HTML elements, such as setting colors, fonts, sizes, margins, and padding.

Separation of Content and Design: CSS separates the content (HTML) from the design, making it easier to maintain and update the design without altering the structure.

Cascading Rules: CSS follows a hierarchical order where styles can cascade (inherit) from multiple sources, such as inline styles, internal styles, and external stylesheets.

Responsiveness: CSS supports responsive design, allowing web pages to adapt to various screen sizes and devices using media queries.

Reusability: Styles defined in an external stylesheet can be reused across multiple web pages, improving consistency and reducing duplication.
