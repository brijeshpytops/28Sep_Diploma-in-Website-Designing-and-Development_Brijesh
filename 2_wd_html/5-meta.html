HTML Meta tag
Meta tags in HTML are used to provide additional information about a webpage. They are placed within the <head> section of an HTML document and are not visible to users but provide essential metadata to search engines, browsers, and other web services. Here are some commonly used meta tags and their purposes: 

<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the webpage. It ensures that the browser interprets and displays the text properly. 
	charset = character set, 
UTF = unicode table format

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: Defines the viewport settings for responsive web design. It ensures that the webpage is displayed appropriately on different devices and screen sizes. 

<meta name="description" content="Description of the webpage">: Provides a brief description of the webpage's content. This description may be displayed in search engine results, social media previews, or browser tooltips. 

<meta name="keywords" content="keyword1, keyword2, keyword3">: Specifies the keywords or phrases relevant to the webpage's content. Although search engines give less importance to this meta tag nowadays, it can still help in some cases. 

<meta name="author" content="Author Name">: Indicates the author of the webpage. 

<meta name="robots" content="index, follow">: Informs search engine crawlers about how to index and follow links on the webpage. Possible values for the content attribute include "index" (allow indexing), "noindex" (prevent indexing), "follow" (allow following links), and "nofollow" (prevent following links). 

<meta name="og:title" content="Title of the webpage">: Provides the title of the webpage that will be displayed when the webpage is shared on social media platforms. 

<meta name="og:description" content="Description of the webpage">: Specifies the description of the webpage that will be displayed when the webpage is shared on social media platforms. 

<meta name="og:image" content="URL of the image">: Specifies the image to be displayed when the webpage is shared on social media platforms. 

These are just a few examples of commonly used meta tags. There are other meta tags available for specific purposes, such as specifying the language, defining the refresh rate, setting the favicon, etc. Meta tags play an important role in optimizing web pages for search engines, improving accessibility, and providing relevant information to users and services interacting with your webpage.
