HTML Tags:
HTML tags are like instructions that tell web browsers how to display content on a webpage. They are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) and usually come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The content placed between the opening and closing tags is affected by the tag's purpose or function. 

For example, the <h1> tag is used to indicate a heading, and it is written as <h1>Heading Text</h1>. The text "Heading Text" will be displayed as a large, prominent heading on the webpage.

HTML Elements:
HTML elements are made up of HTML tags and the content they surround. An HTML element starts with an opening tag, followed by content, and ends with a closing tag. 

For instance, the <p> element is used for creating paragraphs. It is written as <p>Paragraph Text</p>. The text "Paragraph Text" will be displayed as a separate paragraph on the webpage.


Difference      Between HTML Tags and HTML Elements
Criteria	    HTML Tag	                                            HTML Element
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition	    A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets (< >).	An element includes the tag, attributes, and content.
Purpose	        Marks the beginning or end of an element.	            Represents the entire content, structure, and attributes.
Types	        Opening tag (<p>) and closing tag (</p>)	            Element consists of the tag, content, and attributes.
Syntax	        <tagname> or </tagname>	                                <tagname>Content</tagname>
Self-closing	Tags like <img> or <br> don't have a closing tag.	    Self-closing elements use <img src="image.jpg" />
Content	        Does not contain content inside it.	                    Contains content (like text, images, etc.) within it.
Example	        <h1> and </h1>	                                        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
