| **Introduction**           | The standard markup language for web pages, introduced in 1991.                                        | The latest version of HTML, introduced in 2014, with modern web standards in mind.                    |
| **Doctype Declaration**    | Complex and lengthy (`<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "URL">`).         | Simple and concise (`<!DOCTYPE html>`).                                                               |  
| **Audio and Video Support**| Requires third-party plugins like Flash to embed audio and video.                                      | Native support for `<audio>` and `<video>` tags for embedding multimedia.                             |
| **Semantic Elements**      | Limited semantic tags, making it harder to define the structure clearly.                               | Introduced semantic tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<aside>`.            |
| **Graphics and Multimedia**| Requires external tools like Flash or JavaScript for animations and graphics.                          | Native support for `<canvas>` and `<svg>` for graphics and animations.                                |
| **Form Elements**          | Basic form input elements like `<input type="text">` and `<input type="password">`.                    | New input types like `email`, `date`, `url`, `color`, along with features like placeholder text.      |
| **APIs**                   | No direct support for modern APIs; relies heavily on JavaScript and third-party libraries.             | Built-in support for APIs like Geolocation, Web Storage, Drag and Drop, and WebSockets.               |
| **Mobile-Friendly Design** | Not optimized for mobile or responsive design.                                                         | Supports responsive design with features like the `<meta name="viewport">` tag.                       |
| **Error Handling**         | Strict and can break if there are minor syntax errors.                                                 | More forgiving of syntax errors, making it easier to debug and maintain.                              |
| **Performance**            | Limited performance optimizations.                                                                     | Improved performance with modern features like offline caching and lightweight multimedia handling.   |
| **Backward Compatibility** | Fully supported by older browsers.                                                                     | Designed to be backward-compatible with older HTML versions.                                          |
