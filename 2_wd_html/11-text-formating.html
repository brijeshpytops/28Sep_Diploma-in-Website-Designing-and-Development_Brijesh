<!-- 
HTML provides several tags that allow you to format and style text on a webpage. Here are some commonly used tags for text formatting in HTML: 

<strong> and <b>: These tags are used to make text bold. They indicate that the enclosed text should be given strong importance or emphasis. 
For example: 

<p>This is <strong>bold</strong> text.</p> 


<em> and <i>: These tags are used to italicize text. They indicate that the enclosed text should be emphasized or set apart from the surrounding content. 
For example: 

<p>This is <em>italic</em> text.</p>


<u>: This tag is used to underline text. It indicates that the enclosed text should be displayed with an underline. 
For example: 

<p>This is <u>underlined</u> text.</p>


<s>: This tag is used to strike through text. It indicates that the enclosed text should be displayed with a line through the middle. 
For example: 

<p>This is <s>strikethrough</s> text.</p> 


<sub> and <sup>: These tags are used to create subscript and superscript text, respectively. <sub> is used for smaller text that appears below the baseline, while <sup> is used for smaller text that appears above the baseline. 
For example:

<p>This is <sub>subscript</sub> and this is <sup>superscript</sup> text.</p> 


<mark>: This tag is used to highlight or mark a section of text with a background color. It is commonly used to draw attention to specific content. 
For example: 

<p>This is <mark>highlighted</mark> text.</p>


<b>: The <b> tag is used to make text bold. It is a presentational tag that represents the stylistic effect of bolding text. However, it does not convey any semantic meaning. 
For example:

<p>This is <b>bold</b> text.</p> 


 
<i>: The <i> tag is used to italicize text. Similar to the <b> tag, it is a presentational tag that represents the stylistic effect of italicizing text. It does not imply any specific semantic meaning. 
For example: 

    <p>This is <i>italic</i> text.</p>



<strong>: The <strong> tag is used to indicate that the enclosed text is of strong importance or emphasis. By default, browsers render the text within <strong> tags as bold, but its primary purpose is to provide semantic importance rather than visual formatting. 
For example:

<p>This is <strong>strong</strong> text.</p> 


<big>: The <big> tag is used to increase the size of the enclosed text. However, its usage is generally discouraged as it violates the separation of content and presentation. It is recommended to use CSS to control the size of the text. 
For example: 

<p>This is <big>big</big> text.</p> 



<small>: The <small> tag is used to decrease the size of the enclosed text. Similar to the <big> tag, its usage is discouraged, and it is preferable to use CSS for controlling the text size. 
For example: 

<p>This is <small>small</small> text.</p> 



<del> and <s>: Both the <del> and <s> tags are used to represent deleted or struck-through text. They are often used in situations where you want to show that a particular text has been removed or is no longer valid. 
For example: 

<p><del>This is deleted</del> text.</p> <p><s>This is struck-through</s> text.</p> 



<ins>: The <ins> tag is used to represent inserted or underlined text. It indicates that the enclosed text has been added or inserted into the document. By default, browsers render the text within <ins> tags as underlined. 
For example:

<p><ins>This is inserted</ins> text.</p>
