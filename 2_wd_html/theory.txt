Q2] What is a Text Editor for HTML?
    A text editor for HTML is a software application that allows you to write, edit, and manage HTML code. It provides a simple interface for coding and helps developers create, structure, and format web pages. Text editors range from basic editors (like Notepad) to advanced code editors (like VS Code) that offer features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and error detection.

    Types of HTML Text Editors
    HTML text editors can be divided into two categories:

    Basic Text Editors

Q3] What is a Web Browser?
    A web browser is a software application used to access, retrieve, and display content from the World Wide Web (WWW). It allows users to view web pages, play videos, and interact with online services through a graphical user interface (GUI). Web browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code to render web pages on your screen.

    How Does a Web Browser Work?
    - URL Input: You enter a website's URL (e.g., www.google.com) in the browser's address bar.
    - DNS Resolution: The browser contacts a DNS server to convert the URL into an IP address.
    - Request to Server: It sends a request to the web server to access the website's content.
    - Response from Server: The server sends HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files back to the browser.
    - Rendering the Page: The browser processes and displays the web page as text, images, and interactive elements.
