<!-- 
 table is a structured way of displaying data in rows and columns. It allows you to organize and present tabular data in a visually appealing and structured manner. HTML tables consist of several elements that work together to define the table structure and content. 

Table Structure:
The <table> element: It serves as the container for the entire table. 
The <tr> element: It represents a table row and contains the cells of the table. 
The <th> element: It represents a table header cell and is typically used in the first row of the table to define column headings. 
The <td> element: It represents a table data cell and is used to define the content within each cell of the table.

Table caption:
The <caption> element: it provides a caption or title for the table


Table Head, Body, and Footer sections:
The <thead> element: It represents the table head section and contains the header rows. 
The <tbody> element: It represents the table body section and contains the data rows. 
The <tfoot> element: It represents the table footer section and contains footer rows.


Spanning rows and columns:
The colspan attribute: It specifies how many columns a cell should span. 
The rowspan attribute: It specifies how many rows a cell should span.

Cellpadding and cellspacing
	Cellpadding: 

Definition: The cellpadding attribute in HTML tables specifies the amount of space (padding) between the content of a cell and its border. It creates space inside each cell, between the cell content (like text or images) and the cell's border. 
Usage: The value is typically given in pixels.
